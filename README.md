# The-Board
The Board was a small project I did for one of my Game Design classes. The prompt for the project was to create a narrative game that involved cats. For my project I decided to make a game about a bunch of famous cats comprising a co-op board. During the game the player answers their questions. If they answer correctly, they win, else they lose. Questions were crafted so that they were specific to the cat asking them. In turn, players respond according to their knowledge of the catâ€™s character.
